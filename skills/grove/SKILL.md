description: Start, message and read other Grove tabs with the `grove` command. Use whenever the human asks for another session, tab, agent or helper ("new session", "in the same space", "spin up a claude/copilot", "in a worktree", "run this in parallel", "have another agent do X", "use grove to ...") or wants to list spaces and tabs, send a tab a message, read its screen, wait for it, focus or kill it.

# grove

`grove` talks to the running Grove app (the spaces-and-tabs window). Inside a
Grove tab it is on `PATH` when the app's "grove command" install has been
run, otherwise run `bin/grove` from the Grove repo. `GROVE_TAB` names your own
tab. If the app's core is not reachable, a command exits 3.

Vocabulary: a **space** is a folder; a **tab** is one terminal session in a
space, optionally running an agent. A worktree space nests under its main
checkout's space.

A `<ref>` names a tab: its full id, a unique id prefix of at least 4
characters, or its exact label. An unknown or ambiguous ref is an error
(exit 1). `--space REF` names a space: its id, a unique id prefix of at least
4 characters, or the heading `grove ls` prints for it (its path, or `path#2`
for a second space on one folder).

## What the human says, what you run

Defaults inside a Grove tab: the new tab goes in **your own space** and runs
**your own agent kind**. Say less, not more.

| The human says | You run |
|---|---|
| "new session / another tab to do X" | `grove new --prompt "X" --label <name>` |
| "same space" | the default; add `--here` only to be explicit |
| "a copilot / claude / opencode for X" | `grove new copilot --prompt "X" --label <name>` |
| "in a worktree" / "in parallel, separate checkout" | `grove new --worktree <branch> --prompt "X" --label <branch>` |
| "branch it off main/<ref>" | add `--base <ref>` (new branch only; default is this space's HEAD) |
| "in the other space <path>" | `grove new --space <path> --prompt "X"` |
| "and tell me what it finds" / "report back" | add `--wait`, then `grove read <label> --lines 60` |
| "ask that tab ..." | `grove send <label> "..."` (add `--wait` to hear back) |

Fire and forget is the default: start the tab, tell the human its label, and
stop. Use `--wait` only when they ask for the result. Do not `kill` the tab
when it finishes; the human may want to read or resume it.

A shell tab has no agent kind to copy, so from one name the kind. Do not run
`grove ls` first to find your space; the default already uses it.

## Commands

```
grove ls [--json]                    spaces, each with its tabs (id, kind, state, context, label, alive)
grove space add [path]               add a folder as a space (default: the caller folder)
grove space ls                       same listing as ls
grove new [terminal|claude|opencode|copilot] [--here | --cwd DIR | --space REF]
          [--worktree BRANCH [--base REF]] [--label L]
          [--prompt TEXT|-] [--wait] [--timeout S] [--json]
                                     start a tab; prints its id. In a tab: your space and
                                     kind by default
grove send <ref> <TEXT|-> [--no-enter] [--wait] [--timeout S]
                                     paste text into a tab and submit it
grove wait <ref> [--timeout S]       block until the agent stops working
grove read <ref> [--lines N]         the last N lines of the tab's screen (default 100)
grove focus <ref>                    show the tab in the app and raise the window
grove kill <ref>                     end the tab and remove it
grove config path                    print the config folder
grove skill                          install the grove-config skill (how to change Grove's settings)
grove integration install claude | uninstall <claude|copilot>
                                     add or remove the hooks that report hand-typed agents
```

`-` as the text or prompt reads stdin. Inside a Grove tab `new` targets your own
space; outside one, `--cwd` defaults to the folder you run from and must already
be a space: a folder that is not one fails with `not a space`, and
`grove space add <path>` fixes that. `--here`, `--cwd` and `--space` cannot be
combined; `--here` fails outside a Grove tab.

`--worktree BRANCH` opens BRANCH as a worktree space of the target's repo and
starts the tab in it. A branch that is already a space is reused (stderr says
`reusing <path>`); one that exists but is not a space is checked out; a new one
starts at `--base` (any git ref), else the target's HEAD. `--base` with a branch
that exists is an error. It cannot be combined with `--cwd`. Two spaces may share a folder; `--cwd` uses the first.
`--wait` needs an agent: a shell tab has no state to wait on.

A tab's `state` in `ls` is `working`, `needs-you`, `finished`, `idle`,
`unknown`, or `-` for a shell. `unknown` means the agent has reported nothing
(too old, or it never sends status) or the tab is gone.

A tab's `context` in `ls` is how full its agent's context window is, as the
share of the window and a level: `42% ok`, `55% warn`, `75% handoff`. Without a
window it is the token count and level (`120k warn`); `-` means there is no
reading to judge (a shell, no request yet, or just after a compaction). The
level is the first of tokens or share to cross a line: **warn** from 150k tokens
or 50% of the window, **handoff** from 200k tokens or 70%. With `--json`
each tab has `level` (`ok`, `warn`, `handoff` or `null`) and `context`
(`tokens`, `window`, `percent`, `at`, each possibly `null`). Act on `level`;
do not work it out from the numbers.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | done; for `wait` and `--wait`, the turn finished |
| 1 | error, one line on stderr |
| 2 | usage error |
| 3 | the core or holder is not reachable |
| 5 | the tab is gone (it ended) |
| 124 | timed out (default 600 s) |

## Patterns

Hand work to a helper and wait for it:

```
id=$(grove new --space ~/git/other --label helper --prompt "run the tests and summarise failures" --wait)
code=$?
grove read "$id" --lines 60
```

`new` prints the id first and then waits; with `--json` the output is a
single JSON object, so `$id` above is only the id without `--json`.

Ask a running tab something:

```
grove send helper "which files did you change?" --wait && grove read helper --lines 40
```

## Orchestrating

- One step per tab. Start the next only after reading the last one's result,
  and never start a step the human has not approved when the work has a gate.
- Give each tab a self-contained `--prompt`: it does not see your context.
- Name each with `--label`: two to four lowercase words, at most about 28
  characters, no timestamps, with what tells siblings apart first.
- Do small read-only fan-out inside your own session with subagents. A tab is
  for work the human may want to watch, review or resume.
- To keep two tabs from touching the same files, give each its own checkout:
  `grove new --worktree <branch>`. Name the branch from the task in short
  kebab-case, no prefix or date, and use it as the `--label` too, unless the
  human named one. Worktrees stay after `kill`: never delete a worktree space or
  checkout yourself; that is the human's call.

## Watching context

Check `level` in `grove ls --json` at step boundaries only: for yourself (your
row is the tab named by `GROVE_TAB`) after reading a worker's result and before
starting the next step, and for a worker when its `state` is `finished` or
`idle`. Never while it is `working`, and never interrupt a turn to check.

- `ok`, or no level: carry on. A `-` right after a compaction is normal; check
  again at the next step.
- `warn`: start nothing big in that tab. Yourself: stop widening scope and plan
  to hand off at the next step boundary. A worker: send it no new steps; start
  the next one in a fresh tab.
- `handoff`: with work remaining, move it to a new tab. Without any, just
  finish.

Hand off yourself: write a brief and start a fresh tab with it as the prompt:

```
grove new --label orchestrator-2 --prompt - <<'BRIEF'
<brief>
BRIEF
```

The brief is self-contained (the new tab sees none of your context): the goal,
what is done with commit or file pointers, what is next, open decisions and what
the human has approved, and the labels of the live tabs, which it takes over
with `send` and `read`. Name the new tab like the old one with the next number.
Then tell the human the new label and stop; do not wait for it.

Hand off a worker: `grove read <worker> --lines 60`, write the next step's
prompt with what it needs from that screen, and `grove new` a fresh tab for it.
Do not `send` into the old tab, and leave it for the human.

Never `kill` the old tab either way.

## Notes

- `wait` follows Claude, OpenCode and Copilot tabs. A shell tab fails with
  `a shell, it has no agent state to wait on`; use `read` to look at it.
- A tab that needs a permission or a question keeps `wait` waiting: that is for
  the human. Never `send` into a tab that is waiting on a prompt, and never kill
  it to get past one.
- An agent that reports no state (`unknown`) also keeps `wait` waiting until
  the timeout; `read` it to see what it is doing.
- `--wait` first gives the turn up to 30 s to start, then waits for it to end.
- `send` types into the tab even if the human is looking at it, and restarts a
  gone agent tab first (a gone shell tab is an error).
- `kill` ends any tab, including your own. Kill only tabs you started, unless
  asked.
- A new Claude tab in a never-trusted folder shows its trust dialog first; the
  prompt waits behind it.
